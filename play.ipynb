    "A Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer splits text into subword units based on the most frequent character pairs in a corpus,\\\n",

    "Modern BPE tokenizers used for training and inference in large language models typically apply regex-based pretokenization. \\\n",
    "This step splits text into linguistically or visually meaningful chunks (like words or punctuation groups), preventing merges \\\n",
    "across token boundaries that could produce spurious or misleading tokens (e.g., treating \"dog\" and \"dog!\" as entirely different tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex pretokenization also enables more efficient frequency counting: if a word like “text” appears 10 times, we can increment pair counts (like 't','e') by 10 directly.\\\n",
    "When a merge occurs (e.g., 't','e','x','t' → 'te','x','t'), only the keys in the frequency dictionary need to be updated — the total count remains the same, \\\n",

The ball flew away and hit a tree. The tree was hurt. The tree said, \"Ouch! That hurt! Please be careful next time.\"\\nTim felt sorry for the tree. He said, \"I\\'m sorry, tree. I will be more careful.\" He picked up the ball and took it home. Tim\\'s mom ordered a new, soft ball for the tree. The tree was happy, and Tim learned to play more carefully.
